Use Case Example:
A new lead is uploaded by the digital marketing team into the system. The lead is assigned to a telecaller, who contacts the client to determine interest. If the client is interested, the telecaller updates the status and requests required documents. The sales team collects and uploads these documents, which are then verified by the credit manager using integrated credit scoring APIs. If eligible, the credit manager negotiates terms with partner banks and communicates the finalized loan details to the client. Once agreed, the loan is processed and disbursed, with the status updated in the system for tracking and reporting.

Main modules


1.	Lead Management Module


This module focuses on managing potential clients' data, which comes from multiple sources such as social media, email campaigns, and data providers. Once the leads are imported, the system assigns them to telecallers either automatically based on predefined criteria or manually by an admin. Users can filter and sort leads by various parameters like
 
status (e.g., pending, rejected, interested) or source. Duplicate lead entries are identified and automatically moved to a separate section for review, ensuring data integrity. Branch managers and admins can track the overall performance, including lead conversion rates, through dedicated dashboards.


2.	Telecalling Module


The telecalling module empowers telecallers to efficiently manage their daily tasks. Assigned leads appear in their personalized dashboard with all necessary details such as contact information and loan preferences. Telecallers can update the status of each lead as “Interested,” “Not Interested,” “Document Pending,” or “RNR” (Ring No Reply), adding relevant remarks to aid further processing. To streamline communication, the system integrates an email API that allows telecallers to request missing documents from clients. Telecallers' daily performance is tracked, with their progress visible to team leaders and branch managers.


3.	Sales Module

Once a lead is marked as “Interested” by telecallers, it transitions to the sales team. This module enables sales representatives to collect necessary documents from the client and upload them securely into the system. A document tracker ensures all required files are submitted, highlighting missing items for follow-up. Sales personnel also coordinate with credit managers for additional requirements, ensuring a smooth handover. The module generates daily performance reports, allowing team leaders and managers to assess progress and productivity effectively.




4.	Credit Management Module


The credit management module handles loan eligibility assessments and document verification. Credit managers use integrated tools like CIBIL or other credit score APIs to
 
evaluate the client's financial credibility. They can update the lead's status as “Eligible” or “Rejected” based on risk analysis. For eligible cases, this module facilitates communication with multiple banks, helping managers negotiate favorable terms like interest rates and EMIs. The system tracks these discussions and provides a detailed summary to clients for final agreement. Approved loans are processed further, and all decisions are recorded for compliance purposes.


5.	Branch Management Module

This module is tailored for branch managers to oversee and optimize operations at their respective branches. It offers dashboards that display critical performance indicators such as lead status, telecaller productivity, and sales team performance. Branch managers can assign tasks to employees, set targets, and ensure adherence to deadlines. The module also generates branch-specific reports and insights, enabling managers to identify areas for improvement and take corrective action. Automated alerts notify managers about critical updates, such as missed targets or client escalations.


6.	Employee Management (HR Module)

The HR module simplifies employee lifecycle management, starting from recruitment to resignation. HR can add new employees to the system, assign them roles, and allocate them to specific branches. Employee profiles include essential details such as contact information, salary structure, and emergency contacts. Attendance and leave tracking are automated, with notifications for early logins or logouts. HR can also post internal job openings, enabling employees to refer candidates. Payroll processing is streamlined with salary slips, bonus calculations, and compliance documentation.


7.	Reporting and Analytics Module

This module delivers actionable insights through real-time dashboards and customizable reports. Users can generate reports based on parameters like branch performance, sales targets, or loan approval rates. Predictive analytics tools analyze historical data to identify
 
trends and project future outcomes, such as expected loan disbursals. Exporting reports in multiple formats (PDF, Excel) facilitates sharing with stakeholders. Role-specific dashboards ensure users see only the data relevant to their responsibilities, maintaining clarity and security.


8.	Integration and Security

The application integrates seamlessly with third-party services such as CRM platforms, credit score APIs, and banking systems for loan processing. Data security is a top priority, achieved through role-based access control, ensuring users access only what’s necessary for their roles. Audit logs track all user activities for compliance purposes. Regular automated backups ensure that critical data is never lost, and recovery options enable quick restoration in case of unexpected failures. These features make the platform robust and trustworthy for sensitive financial operations.
